This is a small sample chat application. You can chat with a chat bot that will give you automated replies. The app contains a number of errors and some badly structured code. This is intentional.

Your first task is to review the code and then find and fix as many issues as possible.

Especially we would like you to consider:

* Updating the code to modern Objective-C standards, like using ARC/KVO/blocks/properties, etc
* Proper memory management
* Keeping the code readable and easy to modify, like you would in a real application
* Generally agreed patterns and guidelines such as Model-View-Controller, Don't Repeat Yourself and Single Responsibility Principle
* Improve testability, by adding unit tests and/or automation tests (using any framework you like) 

The scope of this is up to you. You can fix issue by issue, or significantly refactor, or anything in between. Everything in the application can be changed, as long as all functionality remains.

Your second task is the improve the user experience of the app. We would like to have an input field at the bottom of the chat view, so you can read and type at the same time, like in iMessage. This feature should replace the existing user interface for sending messages.

We would recommend that you put about 8 hours into this task. Any additional code must be written by you. It is fine to consult external resources, but don’t rely on open source to solve the problems for you. You should also include a change log describing what changes you’ve made and why.

Please use a git repository for this task.
